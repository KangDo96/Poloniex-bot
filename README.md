# Poloniex-bot
Bot for trading on the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange.

This is a bot written while initially self-teaching Python. I would not recommend actually trading with it. It's based heavily on https://github.com/bwentzloff/trading-bot. 

It's also a hot mess of commented-out old code, unused imports, and other embarrassment. I'm probably not going to clean this one up.
